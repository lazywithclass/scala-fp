## scala-fp

Following along John De Goes' course on [Functional Programming in Scala](https://gist.github.com/jdegoes/97459c0045f373f4eaf126998d8f65dc).

### Run

Run the compiler in the Docker VM and code outside, it will sync.

### What I got from these three days

Composition. Type soundness.

It's impressive how things compose so nicely once you
lift the discussion into monoids.
